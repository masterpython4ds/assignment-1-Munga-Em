    ">>> # LOCALIZED MODELS FOR BETTER ESTIMATION OF POVERTY LEVELS - A CASE STUDY OF KIVA\n",
    "\n",
    ">> ## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The war against global poverty has seen tremendous progress, with over 25% of the world population rising out of extreme poverty since 1990. However, 10% of the world's population currently lives in extreme poverty, and half of them live in only 5 economies: India, Nigeria, DRC, Ethiopia and Bangladesh. 41% of the Sub-Saharan population is living in extreme poverty. On the other hand, East Asia and The Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia have less than 3% of their population living in extreme poverty, successfully reaching the 2030 target to eradicate global poverty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Root causes of poverty are not only lack of access to basic necessities (food, shelter, clothing, education, healthcare), but also inequalities including discrimination, conflicts, poor governance and domestic violence. These inequalities also restrict a person's or society's access to social services that could help them overcome poverty. One of these services is financial services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b>:- \n",
    "- More than 1.7 billion adults around the world are unbanked and 56% of all unbanked adults are women. 75% of those living in extreme poverty can’t access the financial services they need. This is not only because of poverty, but also cost, travel distance and bureaucracies. 'Because account ownership is nearly universal in high-income economies, virtually all these unbanked adults live in the developing world. Indeed, nearly half live in just seven developing economies: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Pakistan.'Source: World Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since poverty and financial exclusion looks different in various places and is caused by different factors, the work to eradicate it requires localized models depending on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">> ## BACKGROUND ON KIVA\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiva is an international nonprofit that aims to expand financial inclusion to underserved communities by crowdfunding loans through their site. The site is open to borrowers, lenders, field partners, trustees, among others. A borrower applies for a loan, either directly or through field partners, which then goes through the due diligence process. If it qualifies, it's posted on Kiva for lenders to contribute. The fundraising period is usually not more than 30 days. The borrower then receives the loan and is expected to pay it back according to the terms of the loan. The funds are then paid back to the lenders who can either withdraw, donate or fund other borrowers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of May 2020, Kiva boasts of 1.9 million lenders who have funded loans worth 1.44 billion dollars to 3.6 million borrowers spread across 77 countries with a 96% repayment rate. Unlike other lenders, Kiva doesn't use credit scores in the process of approving loans to borrowers. Instead, approval is based on one's character, impact of the loan on the community and the support one receives from the community. Most loans on Kiva attract a 0% interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b> LOAN PARAMETERS</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Disbursement</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways the loans are disbursed:\n",
    "> - <b>Direct loans</b> :- These loans are fundraised by and paid directly to the borrower. They can not be pre-disbursed, pose a higher risk of default, and are only open to businesses in The U.S and social enterprises internationally.\n",
    "> - <b>Field partner loans</b> :- Loans are fundraised by and paid to Kiva's field partners who then disburse it to the borrowers. Partner loans can be pre-disbursed, where a partner disburses funds to the borrower before the loan is posted on Kiva for crowdfunding. They have a lower risk of default as partners assist in collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Loan length</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Term in months:- Number of months from the disbursement date to the date the last payment is due.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Repayment schedule</b>\n",
    "> Frequency with which payments are sent to Kiva lenders. It could either be bullet, weekly, monthly or irregularly\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <b>Funding model</b>\n",
    "> Shows how funding is sent to the field. There are two options:\n",
    "> - <b>Fixed</b>:- Total amount must be raised for the funds to be sent to the field partner. If the loan is not fully funded, it expires and all contributions are sent back to lenders' Kiva accounts.\n",
    "> - <b>Flexible</b>:- Any funds raised will be disbursed to the field partners who will come up with other sources of funds to cover the deficit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>OBJECTIVES</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build more localized models to estimate poverty levels of residents in the regions where Kiva has active loans.\n",
    "- Explore the data using Python to help Kiva understand their borrowers and their poverty levels\n",
    "- Help Kiva better asses and maximize the impact of their work\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>HYPOTHESIS</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most borrowers are from Sub-Saharan Africa\n",
    "- Loans in regions with lower MPI require fewer lenders to get funding\n",
    "- Countries with higher MPI have higher values of loans\n",
    "- Generally most loans go towards agriculture and education\n",
    "- Most Kiva borrowers are women\n",
    "- Men borrow for revenue generation while women borrow for basic needs\n",
    "- Most loans to Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and East Asia and The Pacific are in the agricultural sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">> ## ASSUMPTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "- All loans missing Partner ID are direct loans\n",
    "- All loans where ['forkiva'] is True are Kiva specific i.e they are not loans to be distributed to borrowers\n",
    "- Where loan amount does not equal funded amount, the loan was either still fundraising at the time or didn't get full funding on Kiva.\n",
    "- The MPI of a world region, in absence of countrywise MPI, generously represents the MPI of the countries in that region.\n",
    "- Regions with higher population living in multi-dimensional poverty also have higher numbers of the world's unbanked population.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> ## SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "- This analysis covers Kiva loans posted between 2014 and 2017"

    "   To make it easy to analyze loans by repayment terms, the terms in months were divided into two quatiles, 0 - 13 months being short term loans while anything over 13 months being a long term loan. Long term loans, and the education, entertainment, housing, manufacturing, personal use and wholesale sectors do not have weekly repayment plans.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Most borrowers across all sectors prefer the monthly repayment plan, followed by irregular and bullet at a distant second and third preference respectively. The weekly plan has very few fans. Sectors such as agriculture, education and manufacturing that take time for the investment to yield returns have more than half of their loans under the monthly repayment plan rather than bullet. It would be interesting to have the actual repayment data analyzed to see what percentage is actually paid up in the first few months, especially for agricultural sector. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   A huge share of loans to the clothing, food and retail sectors are short term. Further analysis of specific uses of loans in these sectors is needed to identify whether they are for income generating activities or consumption. This would help Kiva and the field partners in analyzing the impact of their work as loans for consumption purposes have very little effect in increasing financial inclusion or ending the cycle of poverty.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In terms of repayment plans, clothing, food and retail sectors are the only ones where short term loans heavily outnumber long term lonas. This shows that most of the borrowers in those sectors live hand to mouth and daily incomes can't cover all their basic needs(food and clothing) at once. Short term loans in retail sector could mean most of the traders with access to Kiva loans struggle to keep their businesses afloat and are constantly seeking credit. This can be backed up by the fact that the highest number of their loans are under the irregular repayment plan and few under bullet, due to the uncertainities they are probably aware of.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Loans to agriculture, education and housing sectors are largely long term. This maybe because they are capital intensive sectors that have long periods before one recovers their investment."
